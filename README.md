# An exploration of linear classification

This project is an overview of some techniques used in linear classification, and is inspired from the MVA course "Probabilistic Graphical Models", taught by Pierre Latouche and Nicolas Chopin (2019). After some recalls on MLE and the computation of a MLE, the LDA and QDA models are explored, as well as logistic and linear regression applied to classification.
